# liri-node-app

### This project uses node to run the js logic that grabs the user input
### It allows users to search the omdbi api to find movie info, to search the bands in town api to find nearby concerts in real time, and to search the spotify api to find song info for favorite artists 
### Users simply type in commands into the CLI terminal to run each function
### The user input from the CLI at process.argv[2] used to give the commands for each function are "movie", "concert", and "song."  
### The command "doWhat" will grab a string from the log.txt file to run a default key word for the "addSong" function Currently it returns the info for the song "I want it That Way"
